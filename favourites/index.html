      too many games but i have kept up with a few. for example:

<li> <a href="https://playvalorant.com" target="_blank">valorant </a></li>

</ul>

    <h2 class="drawing">drawing</h2>
    <p>
      another one of my pastimes is drawing. I've never cared for art when i was
      younger but I've grown to like it more now. I started drawing after taking
      art in grade 8 due to covid. I'm not the best but I am improving
